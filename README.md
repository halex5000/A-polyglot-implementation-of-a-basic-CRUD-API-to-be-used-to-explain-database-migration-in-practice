# Basic CRUD API

Anyone who knows me knows I love a good burger, so of course, my API is burger inspired.

This project will model the creation of a basic CRUD API in a number of different languages for creating a burger order.

Each implementation will implement several fundamental needs:

- Request Handling and Validation
- Business logic implementation
- Data Access
- Serialization and Deserialization



## The Project

The project at it's root is a Node.js project because I love some of the tooling for Node projects like [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=automatic-recommended) for Git Hooks.



## Intent

As a means to model heterogenous database migration techniques, strategies, and common problems and solutions, this basic CRUD API is implemented in a variety of languages.



## Data

The project comes "batteries included" with in memory Postgres and DynamoDB mocks so you can run each API as if it is connected to a "real" database and see the differences in implementation as we move from one database to another.



## Node.js/Typescript/JavaScript
